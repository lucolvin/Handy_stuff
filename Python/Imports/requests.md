`import requests` in Python is a common statement to include the "requests" library, which simplifies the process of making HTTP requests. This library is widely used for various purposes, including:

1. **Fetching Web Pages:** The `requests` library allows you to make HTTP GET requests, making it easy to retrieve HTML content from websites. This is useful for web scraping or extracting information from websites.

    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.get('https://example.com')
    print(response.text)
    ```

2. **API Requests:** Many APIs require sending HTTP requests to retrieve or send data. `requests` simplifies this process by providing methods like `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` for different HTTP methods.

    ```python
    import requests

    # GET request
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

    # POST request with data
    payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
    response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/post', data=payload)
    ```

3. **Handling Response:** `requests` makes it easy to handle the response, whether it's checking the status code, accessing headers, or parsing the response content.

    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.get('https://example.com')
    
    # Check status code
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print('Success!')
    
    # Access headers
    print(response.headers)
    ```

4. **Downloading Files:** You can download files from the internet using `requests`, which is handy for automating tasks like downloading images, PDFs, or other resources.

    ```python
    import requests

    url = 'https://example.com/image.jpg'
    response = requests.get(url)

    with open('image.jpg', 'wb') as file:
        file.write(response.content)
    ```

5. **Session Handling:** The `requests` library supports session management, allowing you to persist certain parameters across multiple requests, such as authentication credentials or cookies.

    ```python
    import requests

    # Create a session
    session = requests.Session()

    # Use the session for multiple requests
    response1 = session.get('https://example.com/login')
    response2 = session.get('https://example.com/dashboard')
    ```
